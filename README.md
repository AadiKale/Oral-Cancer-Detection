# Oral-Cancer-Detection
I was working on a project of oral cancer detection using computer vision.
I have tried different CNN models; pre-trained as well as self designed CNN architectures.
NOTE: the models were made on extremely less amount of data so they show overfitting, may have to fine tune for large datasets.
